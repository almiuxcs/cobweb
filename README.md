Cobweb plotter
=========================== 

This is a simple code in Python 3 using the matplotlib libary to plot 
a cobweb graph. More information about cobweb plot can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_plot).
Also, a online cobweb plotter can be found [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/unan9xh0og), where it was used as a inspiration to do this code.

## About

This code plots the functions y = x in red, in the interval [0, 1.2] x [0, 1.2]
and the graph of 
	
	f(x) = a * x * (1 - x)

Then, applys the map to the initial point given. 

## Examples 

Plot using a = 2, and x_0 as 0.1
